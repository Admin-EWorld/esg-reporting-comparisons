# Quantum Computing and Sustainable Finance

The convergence of quantum computing and the financial sector is set to revolutionize modeling, risk assessment, and portfolio optimization. Crucially for ESG reporting, quantum algorithms offer pathways to create truly **ESG-friendly stock portfolios** by efficiently incorporating sustainability metrics alongside traditional risk/return calculations (Source: MDPI). Furthermore, the potential for quantum computers to be **significantly cheaper and environmentally friendlier** to operate aligns with broader sustainability goals, satisfying ESG and regulatory concerns (Source: BizTech Magazine). Investment firms are exploring quantum methods for complex tasks like derivative pricing and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) assessment, which underpins robust, long-term financial stability. This technological shift promises not only superior financial performance but also a more transparent and sustainable future for finance.
