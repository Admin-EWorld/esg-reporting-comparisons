# Best Workiva Alternatives for Mid-Market Private Equity (2026)

For mid-market private equity (PE) firms, the complex, enterprise-grade features of Workiva can often feel like overkill. While Workiva is a powerhouse for public companies, PE firms need platforms that prioritize portfolio company data collection, ease of use for smaller teams, and specialized private market metrics.

Here are the top 5 alternatives for mid-market private equity in 2026.

## 1. Novata

- **Key Features:** Private market benchmarking, custom metric selection, and data contextualization.
- **Why it's a Workiva Alternative:** It is significantly more focused on the GP-LP relationship and the unique data challenges of private companies than Workiva's broad enterprise focus.

## 2. Pulsora
**Best for: All-in-One Sustainability Management**

Pulsora provides a dynamic platform that handles everything from carbon footprinting to performance improvement tracking across a diverse portfolio.

- **Key Features:** Automated data ingestion, Scope 1-3 calculation, and real-time performance dashboards.

- **Key Features:** Board reporting integration, audit-ready data, and verified information tracking.
- **Why it's a Workiva Alternative:** Leverages Diligent's existing board portal dominance to provide a more integrated governance experience.

## 4. Greenly
**Best for: Decarbonization and Mid-Market Portfolios**

Greenly is an excellent choice for mid-market firms focused heavily on carbon accounting and helping their portfolio companies decarbonize.

- **Key Features:** Personalized dashboards, collaborative tools, and simplified audit trails.
- **Why it's a Workiva Alternative:** Lower cost and higher focus on operational decarbonization rather than just compliance reporting.

- **Why it's a Workiva Alternative:** Reviewers often rate Prophix higher for mid-market implementations where financial and ESG data must coexist seamlessly.

## Conclusion
