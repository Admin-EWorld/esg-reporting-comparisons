For real estate portfolio managers, generalist ESG tools like **Sustain.Life** often fall short when it comes to the granular, asset-level data required for certifications like GRESB or building-specific compliance. While Sustain.Life is an excellent entry point for SMBs, real estate professionals need deep integration with building management systems (BMS) and IoT data.

In this guide, we compare the top industry-specific alternatives for real estate in 2026.

## 1. Measurabl: The Industry Standard
**Measurabl** is widely considered the leading ESG platform specifically for the real estate and asset management sectors. It automates the collection of utility data (electricity, water, waste) directly from thousands of utility providers.

*   **Best for:** Large-scale commercial real estate portfolios.
*   **Key Advantage:** Direct integration with GRESB and ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager.
*   **Comparison to Sustain.Life:** Much more asset-focused and specialized for property management workflows.

## 2. Facilio: Real-Time Operational Insights
**Facilio** is a property operations platform that has built a robust ESG module. Unlike tools that just report on past data, Facilio connects to IoT sensors and BMS to provide real-time sustainability monitoring.

*   **Best for:** Technical facility managers and owners of "Smart Buildings."
*   **Key Advantage:** The ability to take action (e.g., adjust HVAC settings) based on real-time ESG data to actively reduce footprints.
*   **Comparison to Sustain.Life:** More "operational" and technical, focusing on active building management rather than just reporting.

## 3. Deepki: Leading the European Market
For portfolio managers with heavy exposure to European regulations (like CSRD or the EU Taxonomy), **Deepki** offers a powerful data intelligence platform. It excels in long-term ESG planning and "Net Zero" roadmap visualization.

*   **Best for:** Institutional investors and asset managers in the EU.
*   **Key Advantage:** Deep expertise in European regulatory alignment and carbon risk assessment.
*   **Comparison to Sustain.Life:** Much stronger on complex regulatory frameworks and long-term investment strategy.

## 4. Singu FM: Best for Technical Data Aggregation
**Singu FM** focuses on the technical side of property management. It integrates IoT sensors and smart metering into a facility management suite, making it a "bottom-up" ESG reporting tool.

*   **Best for:** Industrial and technical property portfolios.
*   **Key Advantage:** Seamless integration with physical building hardware.
*   **Comparison to Sustain.Life:** A better fit for those who want to aggregate data from the factory or warehouse floor.
