# AI in Finance: Comparing Top Software for ESG Data Management

The intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting is rapidly maturing within the financial sector. AI tools are essential for handling the massive, unstructured datasets required for compliance (like CSRD, EU taxonomy) and strategic decision-making.

This comparison focuses on three leading platforms that leverage AI to transform ESG data management in finance: Workiva, Tanso, and solutions integrating Microsoft's AI stack.
