The primary global standard for carbon footprint reporting is the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). It provides accounting requirements and guidance for reporting emissions, including the seven Kyoto Protocol gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3), and covers methodologies for technologies like direct air capture and geological storage. Many corporate reports align with these standards.
