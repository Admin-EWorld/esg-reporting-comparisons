- Top 11 ESG Reporting Software Platforms in 2026

Navigating the world of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) software can be tricky – there’s so many choices out there, and they all offer unique benefits, advantages, and challenges. That's why we've put together a comparison of the top 11 ESG software platforms for 2026.
In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down what you need to know about ESG software, and how to make the right choice for your organization.

## What is environmental, social, and governance (ESG)?

[Environmental, social, and governance (ESG)](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-esg-reporting-how-you-can-prepare-your-organization-for-it/) refers to a set of practices and metrics used to evaluate a company’s performance. ESG has gained popularity in recent years to evaluate a company’s risk in the marketplace, and their commitment to bettering the world.

[ESG metrics](https://www.prophix.com/blog/how-to-prepare-and-write-a-stellar-esg-report/) are not commonly part of mandatory financial reporting, although companies are increasingly making disclosures in their annual reports or creating standalone "sustainability reports".

### Environmental

Environmental metrics, as they relate to the measurement of ESG, usually include performance indicators on the impact on nature, materials, waste, pollution, water, greenhouse gases, and energy.

Often, the goal of [ESG reporting](https://www.prophix.com/use-case/esg-reporting/) is to demonstrate a company’s efforts to lessen their impact on the environment, by asking questions such as: How much water is being used in the manufacturing process? How many greenhouse gases does company travel generate? Where are materials sourced from?

### Social

Social metrics measure how well a company is treating its employees, suppliers, community, and customers, by considering factors like an organization’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), compensation, and turnover.

If a company treats its employees well, this can indicate to investors that the organization is stable and a good investment.

### Governance

Governance refers to how social and environmental metrics are measured and presented in financial reports. Governance also considers how a company’s social and environmental goals will impact their bottom line, and what achieving the goals will result in. It relates to how a company is governed and includes aspects such as board composition, executive compensation, audits and internal controls, shareholder rights, and transparency. 

### What is ESG reporting?

[ESG reporting](https://www.prophix.com/use-case/esg-reporting/) is the process whereby companies disclose their environmental, social, and governance data in financial reports. The goal of [ESG reporting](https://www.prophix.com/blog/how-to-prepare-and-write-a-stellar-esg-report/) is to improve transparency for investors and stakeholders and demonstrate that a company’s ESG projects are legitimate and progressing.

At this point in time, no standard for [ESG reporting](https://www.prophix.com/blog/a-guide-to-2024-esg-regulations-in-canada-across-the-globe/) exists in North America. However, there are several regional reporting standards, voluntary standards, and legislation that can guide companies. In addition, organizations like the [Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)](https://www.prophix.com/blog/7-esg-report-examples-for-finance-teams/) and the [Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)](https://www.prophix.com/blog/7-esg-report-examples-for-finance-teams/) provide widely recognized frameworks. The Task Force on [Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)](https://www.prophix.com/blog/a-guide-to-2024-esg-regulations-in-canada-across-the-globe/) also offers specific guidelines for reporting on climate risks.

In contrast, the European Union has developed a robust set of [ESG reporting standards](https://prophix.com/blog/a-guide-to-2024-esg-regulations-in-canada-across-the-globe/) in response to the EU Green Deal. The EU's [Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)](https://www.prophix.com/blog/7-esg-report-examples-for-finance-teams/) requires large companies to disclose certain information on the way they operate and manage social and environmental challenges. Furthermore, the EU is working on the [Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)](https://www.prophix.com/blog/7-esg-report-examples-for-finance-teams/), which aims to strengthen [sustainability reporting](https://www.prophix.com/sustainability-officer) requirements.

### How ESG reporting benefits companies

Companies can use [ESG reporting](https://www.prophix.com/use-case/esg-reporting/) to reap the benefits of:

- Enhanced reputation: Companies that disclose their [ESG metrics](https://www.prophix.com/blog/how-to-prepare-and-write-a-stellar-esg-report/) often see an enhanced reputation among customers, investors, and the wider public. This can lead to increased loyalty, a stronger brand, and the potential for greater market share.
- Attracting investors: Many investors now incorporate ESG metrics into their decision-making process. By demonstrating strong ESG performance, companies can attract socially conscious investors.
- Reduced risk: ESG reporting helps identify and manage risks related to environmental, social, and governance issues. This can help prevent reputational damage, fines, or other negative impacts.
- Cost savings: ESG initiatives often lead to more efficient use of resources, which can result in significant cost savings. For example, reducing energy consumption not only lowers environmental impact but also decreases utility bills.
- Competitive advantage: As consumers become more aware of and concerned about sustainability issues, companies that demonstrate strong ESG performance can gain a competitive advantage.
- Transparency: Transparency is increasingly important to stakeholders. [ESG reporting](https://www.prophix.com/use-case/esg-reporting/) demonstrates a company's commitment to openness and honesty about its impacts and efforts to improve.

## What is ESG software?

ESG Software is a specialized tool that enables businesses to track, report, and improve their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. It provides a comprehensive view of a company's ESG efforts, helping them to identify areas of improvement, manage risks, and make informed decisions that align with their sustainability goals.

Overall, ESG software simplifies the process of managing [sustainability data](https://www.prophix.com/sustainability-officer) and compliance with various [ESG reporting standards](https://prophix.com/blog/a-guide-to-2024-esg-regulations-in-canada-across-the-globe/).

### Why is ESG software important?

ESG software is important because it can eliminate a lot of the manual effort associated with collecting and compiling sustainability data. ESG software can also create a single source of data truth for organizations, improving communication and giving stakeholders access to the data they need to make decisions.

Beyond these core benefits, embracing ESG software can keep your organization at the forefront of the changing regulatory environment and satisfy the increasing call for transparency in ESG performance.

### How does ESG software work?

ESG software has functionality to support the reporting process, including:

- Data collection: ESG software can automate the process of collecting data from various sources across an organization, reducing the time and effort required to gather this information manually.
- Data validation: ESG software can validate data to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This is crucial because inaccurate data can lead to misleading [ESG reports.](https://www.prophix.com/blog/7-esg-report-examples-for-finance-teams/)
- Data compilation and analysis: ESG software can compile data into a centralized database, making it easier to analyze and understand. It can also analyze trends, compare performance against benchmarks, and highlight areas for improvement.
- Reporting: ESG software often includes reporting tools that allow companies to produce standardized ESG reports in line with various reporting frameworks. These reports can be used for internal decision-making, external communication, or [regulatory compliance](https://www.prophix.com/blog/maximizing-business-reporting-efficiency-prophix-partners-with-iris-carbon).
- Risk management and decision support: By providing a clear view of a company's ESG performance, ESG software can identify risks and opportunities related to ESG factors, supporting strategic decision-making and goal setting.
- Integration with other systems: ESG software can often integrate with other business systems, such as ERP or HRIS systems, to streamline data collection and improve overall sustainability management.

### How big is the market for ESG software?

The market for ESG software is experiencing substantial growth. [As of 2022, the global ESG reporting software market size was valued at approximately $0.7 billion](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/20/2630439/0/en/ESG-Reporting-Software-Market-worth-1-5-billion-by-2027-growing-at-a-CAGR-of-15-9-Report-by-MarketsandMarkets.html). It's expected to more than double, reaching around $1.5 billion. This surge is due to an increasing demand for transparency in ESG performance and compliance with evolving regulations.

## Benefits of ESG reporting software

Now that you understand what ESG is, how ESG software works, and key functionality to look for, let’s dive into the benefits.

### Compliance with evolving regulations

While it is not mandatory to publish [ESG reports](https://www.prophix.com/blog/how-to-prepare-and-write-a-stellar-esg-report/) right now, it seems the industry is heading in that direction. Investing in dedicated ESG software can help you comply more efficiently with [evolving mandates](https://www.prophix.com/blog/regulatory-reporting-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-ahead-and-be-prepared). ESG software streamlines the process of data collection, validation, and report generation - saving both time and resources.

### Enhanced decision-making

[ESG reporting](https://www.prophix.com/use-case/esg-reporting/) software provides access to accurate, up to date ESG data, which can be used to make informed decisions that align with your company's sustainability goals. It can also help you benchmark your ESG performance, identify areas for improvement, and set meaningful sustainability targets.

### Increased transparency and confidence

Transparency in ESG performance is vital for stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees. ESG software allows you to create comprehensive, standardized reports that clearly communicate your ESG efforts, thereby building stakeholder trust and potentially attracting more investments and customer loyalty.
